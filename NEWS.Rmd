2015-05-01. WRF-Hydro v3.0.0.

## New Features (all are new!)
This is not an exhaustive list, but is simply culled from the more relevant commit messages. Future change logs will be more informative with bug references.

* ReadCoDwrGage: read CO Dept Water Resources Gage files.

* Multi-basin streamflow eval vignette. 

* New reasmple type option to GetMODIS.

* Using Travis-CI via the new .travis.yml file with native R support: automated build checks on push and pull request (incl. slack notification). Ncdf and rgdal are installed during the check. 

* Appending to unlimited dimensions in ncdf files in MkNcdf.

* CalcModPerf accounts for uneven timesteps in timing stats with output as single row for multi-runs.

* Fixed startup to check for updates can be suppressed with suppressPackageStartupMessages().

* GagesII attribute information in gages2Attr and gages2AttrPlus with documentation and attribution. 

* An rwrfhydro discovery vignette.

* Parallelization of GetSnodasDepthSweDate.

* Snodas vignette.

* FormalsToDf: the suggested way to handle vector arguments (collated across multiple vector arguments) to rwrfhydro routines. 

* MODIS processing routines and vignette.

* Common functions in utilities doc.

* PlotFluxCompare and visualize_modeleval.

* Read in LDASOUT and RTOUT files for water budget calcs: CalcNoahmpWatBudg.

* Functionality for reading WRF-Hydro output.

* Reading USGS and Ameriflux obs data.

* Calculating model performance statistics.

* Snodas retrieval and processing to ncdf (incl a useful matrix rotation utility!).

* MkNcdf: list-based creation of ncdf files using netcdf v4 (later added appending to unlimited dimensions).

* VisualizeChanNtwk: Understanding the seemingly random channel network, gauge-link matching, plot options, point selection with maps, etc.
