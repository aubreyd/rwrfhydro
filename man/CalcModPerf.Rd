\title{Computes model performance statistics for WRF-Hydro flux output}
\usage{
CalcModPerf(flxDf.mod, flxDf.obs, flxCol.mod = "q_cms",
  flxCol.obs = "q_cms", stdate = NULL, enddate = NULL,
  subdivisions = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{flxDf.mod}{The flux output dataframe (required). Assumes only one
forecast point per file, so if you have multiple forecast points in your
output dataframe, use subset to isolate a single forecast point's data.
Also assumes model output and observation both contain POSIXct fields
(called "POSIXct").}

\item{flxDf.obs}{The observed flux dataframe. Assumes only one observation
point per file, so if you have multiple observation points in your
dataframe, use subset to isolate a single point's data. Also assumes model
output and observation both contain POSIXct fields (called "POSIXct").}

\item{flxCol.mod}{The column name for the flux time series for the MODEL data
(default="q_cms")}

\item{flxCol.obs}{The column name for the flux time series for the OBSERVED
data (default="q_cms")}

\item{stdate}{Start date for statistics (DEFAULT=NULL, all records will be
used). Date MUST be specified in POSIXct format with appropriate timezone
(e.g., as.POSIXct("2013-05-01 00:00:00", format="\%Y-\%m-\%d \%H:\%M:\%S",
tz="UTC"))}

\item{enddate}{End date for statistics (DEFAULT=NULL, all records will be
used). Date MUST be specified in POSIXct format with appropriate timezone
(e.g., as.POSIXct("2013-05-01 00:00:00", format="\%Y-\%m-\%d \%H:\%M:\%S",
tz="UTC"))}

\item{subdivisions}{Number of subdivisions used in flow duration curve
integration (DEFAULT=1000); increase value if integrate function throws an
error.}
}
\value{
A new dataframe containing the model performance statistics.
}
\description{
\code{CalcModPerf} calculates model performance statistics for flux output.
}
\details{
\code{CalcModPerf} reads a model flux time series (i.e., created using
\code{\link{ReadFrxstPts}}) and an observation time series (i.e., created
using \code{\link{ReadUsgsGage}}) and calculates model performance statistics
(Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency, Rmse, etc.) at various time scales and for low
and high fluxes. The tool will subset data to matching time periods (e.g., if
the observed data is at 5-min increments and modelled data is at 1-hr
increments, the tool will subset the observed data to select only
observations on the matching hour break).

Performance Statistics: \cr (mod = model output, obs = observations, n =
sample size) \itemize{ \item n: sample size \item nse: Nash-Sutcliffe
Efficiency \deqn{nse = 1 - ( sum((obs - mod)^2) / sum((obs - mean(obs))^2) )
} \item nselog: log-transformed Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency \deqn{nselog = 1 -
( sum((log(obs) - log(mod))^2) / sum((log(obs) - mean(log(obs)))^2) ) } \item
cor: correlation coefficient \deqn{cor = cor(mod, obs) } \item rmse: root
mean squared error \deqn{rmse = sqrt( sum((mod - obs)^2) / n ) } \item
rmsenorm: normalized root mean squared error \deqn{rmsenorm = rmse /
(max(obs) - min(obs)) } \item bias: percent bias \deqn{bias = sum(mod - obs)
/ sum(obs) * 100 } \item mae: mean absolute error \deqn{mae = mean(abs(mod -
obs)) } \item errcom: error in the center-of-mass of the flux, where
center-of-mass is the hour/day when 50\% of daily/monthly/water-year flux has
occurred. Reported as number of hours for daily time scale and number of days
for monthly and yearly time scales. \item errmaxt: Error in the time of
maximum flux. Reported as number of hours for daily time scale and number of
days for monthly and yearly time scales). \item errfdc: Error in the
integrated flow duration curve between 0.05 and 0.95 exceedance thresholds
(in native flow units). }

Time scales/Flux types: \itemize{ \item ts = native model/observation time
step (e.g., hourly) \item daily = daily time step \item monthly = monthly
time step \item yearly = water-year time step \item max10 = high flows;
restricted to the portion of the time series where the observed flux is in
the highest 10\% (native time step) \item min10 = low flows; restricted to
the portion of the time series where the observed flux is in the lowest 10\%
(native time step) }
}
\examples{
## Take forecast point model output for Fourmile Creek (modStrh.mod1.fc) and a corresponding
## USGS gage observation file (obsStrh.fc), both at an hourly time step, and calculate
## model performance statistics. The model forecast point data was imported using ReadFrxstPts
## and the gage observation data was imported using ReadUsgsGage.
